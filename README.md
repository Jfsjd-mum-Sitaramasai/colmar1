This project is to display the web page about colmar academy.

The web page describes the information like orientation,campus place ,timings of orientation and about the guest lecture that  is happening on opening days.it also describe the courses offered in academy and what they learn in that course and the contact details for any queries.

Here I used html and css to build the webpage and also a bootstrap tool for more responsiveness.
